Hello, world! Welcome to my Blog!

<!---who am I?-->
<!---<p style="text-align: center;"> Who am I? </p>-->
I am a graduate student in Natural Resources and Environmental Studies at University of Northern BC, under the supervision of Dr. Balbinder Deo. My research field in this master's degree is an estimation of socila cost/loss of food waste/loss. Besides, I am also interested in:
- Consumer Theory in Microeconomics
- Text Analysis in Computational Social Science
- Regression Analysis in Statistics

and

- Cooking!! - I used to work at a Japanese restaturant for more than five years.

<!---Purpose: I want to establish myself as an authority in my niche. Include links to online interviews or include video if you have it. Link to articles you’ve written at other sites. Include a few quotes from people who have used your information.
-->

<!---Purpose: I want to speak at conferences or be a consultant. Include information about your experience and why a company would want to hire you. Tell them again what sets you apart from others in your niche.
-->

<!---Purpose: I want to find a sponsor to help defray my costs to an event. While you’ll want to reach out to companies individually with customized requests, it can’t hurt to include this information where people can find it. Include exactly what you’re looking for and what you’ll provide for the company in return. The more information you can give, the better.
-->

<!---Purpose: I want to work with marketers to host giveaways or provide reviews. Include a link to your disclosure policy and explain what types of products you’re interested in receiving and why (you don’t want to be pitched for baby food if you don’t have kids or if your kids are teens). Give an overview of your traffic statistics (e.g., I reach mostly women who are interested in teaching themselves about technology). You don’t have to give everything away (i.e., specific numbers or demographics), generalities are OK as long as they convey enough information to pique the visitor’s interest.
