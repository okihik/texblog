<h2>The Mundell-Fleming Model is back!!</h2>
<p>The Japanese yen is currently blasting off to a low of over ¥ 134 to USD 1.
This is likely due to the Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda’s statement that “households are becoming more tolerant of price hikes.”
His tone was that the yen should weaken further,
and the market probably reacted to this.</p>

<h3>Differences in interest rates promote international capital flows</h3>
<p>This effect can be explained by the classic Mundell-Fleming model.
Consider the <span class="math inline">\(IS-LM\)</span> model in an open economy,
where international capital flows are completely free and the real interest rate is fixed at <span class="math inline">\(i_w\)</span> throughout the world, and
FE is the equilibrium real interest rate curve and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is income.</p>

<p>Under a flexible exchange rate system,
even if the budget deficit is increased and the <span class="math inline">\(IS\)</span> curve is moved to the right to <span class="math inline">\(IS^1\)</span>, the Japanese interest rate, determined by the intersection with the <span class="math inline">\(LM\)</span> curve, will be higher than <span class="math inline">\(i^W\)</span>, causing capital inflows, a stronger yen, and lower exports.
This change will continue until the real interest rate returns to its equilibrium level <span class="math inline">\(i^w\)</span>, so the <span class="math inline">\(IS\)</span> curve will return to its original level and fiscal policy will be ineffective.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if monetary policy increases the money supply to <span class="math inline">\(LM^1\)</span>, the domestic interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i&#39;\)</span>, which is determined by the intersection with <span class="math inline">\(IS\)</span>, becomes lower than the foreign interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i^W\)</span>, resulting in capital outflows and a weaker yen.
This change continues until <span class="math inline">\(i&#39; = i^W\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(IS\)</span> curve shifts to <span class="math inline">\(IS^1\)</span>, which increases <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, so monetary policy is effective.</p>

<h3>Effective of Monetary Depreciation but Ineffective of Fiscal Deficits</h3>
<p>However, as the difference in interest rates between Japan and the U.S. increases, this will increase foreign investment and shift the <span class="math inline">\(IS\)</span> curve to the right, thereby increasing GNP (including foreign investment).
In other words, the budget deficit does not work,
but inducing the yen to depreciate does.</p>
<p>In the past, a weak yen caused investment to increase due to export growth,
but now there is a massive capital flight of yen borrowed at zero interest rates to invest in Asia.
The BOJ’s cheap money was invested in Asia.</p>
<p>If the dollar continues at this rate to around 140 yen to the dollar, global companies will improve their performance and GNP will grow significantly.
However, domestic GDP will not grow.
Manufacturing employment will not increase and wages will not rise because of increased outsourcing overseas.</p>
<p>This is the globalization of the world economy that has been underway since the 1990s and cannot be stopped.
While we need to be careful about resource inflation and economic security,
we should not be afraid of the weak yen.
If the yen continues to depreciate to the 140 yen level over the long term, we can expect companies that have gone overseas to return to Japan.
This seems to be the goal of Governor Kuroda.
Tourists and inward direct investment will also increase.</p>
<p>However, the gap between large global corporations and small and medium-sized domestic firms will widen.
This is because the weak yen will lead to import inflation and lower real wages.</p>
<p>To remedy this, in my opinion, the current complicated and ad hoc social security system should be replaced by a lump-sum redistribution system such as a basic income, a negative income tax, or minimum guaranteed pension.</p>
